   - âœ… Auto-tagging
5. Click **Submit**

**Benefits:**

### 2. **Verify GA4 is Collecting Data Properly**

**Check in GA4 Dashboard:**
1. Go to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com)
2. Select property: `G-M09V20CNVF`
3. Go to **Reports** â†’ **Realtime**
4. Open your website in another tab
5. You should see yourself as an active user

**Check Key Reports:**
- **Life Cycle** â†’ **Acquisition** â†’ **Traffic acquisition** (see where visitors come from)
- **Life Cycle** â†’ **Engagement** â†’ **Events** (verify your conversion events)
- **Life Cycle** â†’ **Monetization** â†’ **Ecommerce purchases** (if you set up ecommerce)

---

### 3. **Set Up GA4 Enhanced Measurement**

Enhanced measurement tracks user interactions automatically.

**Enable in GA4:**
1. Go to **Admin** â†’ **Data Streams**
2. Click on your web stream
3. Toggle **Enhanced measurement** ON
4. Make sure these are enabled:
   - âœ… Page views
   - âœ… Scrolls (90% scroll depth)
   - âœ… Outbound clicks
   - âœ… Site search
   - âœ… Video engagement
   - âœ… File downloads

---

### 4. **Set Up GA4 Key Events (Conversions)**

Tell GA4 which events matter most for your business.

**Create Key Events:**
1. Go to **Admin** â†’ **Events**
2. Look for these events (your code already tracks them):
   - `conversion` (from your conversion tracking)
   - `form_submit` (inquiry forms)
   - `purchase` (if you set up ecommerce tracking)
3. Click **Mark as key event** for important ones

**Benefits:**
- Google Ads optimizes campaigns for key events
- Better attribution reporting
- Improved audience building

---

### 5. **Set Up Google Tag Manager (GTM)** - RECOMMENDED

GTM makes tracking management much easier without code changes.

**Why GTM?**
- Add/modify tracking without deploying code
- Test tags before going live
- Manage all tracking (GA4, Google Ads, Facebook Pixel) in one place
- Better debugging tools

**Setup Steps:**

#### A. Create GTM Account
1. Go to [Google Tag Manager](https://tagmanager.google.com)
2. Create account â†’ Web container
3. Copy your GTM ID (format: `GTM-XXXXXXX`)

#### B. Update Your .env File
```env
# Replace GTM-XXXXXXX with your real GTM ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM_ID="GTM-XXXXXXX"
```

#### C. Configure Tags in GTM
1. **GA4 Configuration Tag**:
   - Tag Type: Google Analytics: GA4 Configuration
   - Measurement ID: `G-M09V20CNVF`
   - Trigger: All Pages

2. **Google Ads Conversion Linker**:
   - Tag Type: Conversion Linker
   - Trigger: All Pages

3. **Custom Events** (for better tracking):
   - Package view events
   - Add to cart/wishlist
   - Search queries
   - Phone/WhatsApp clicks

---

### 6. **Create Google Ads Audiences from GA4**

Use your GA4 data to create better targeting audiences.

**Recommended Audiences:**
1. **Users who viewed packages but didn't book** (30 days)
   - Good for remarketing campaigns

2. **High-value visitors** (multiple page views, long session)
   - Bid higher for similar users

3. **Cart abandoners** (started booking but didn't complete)
   - Retarget with special offers

**How to Create:**
1. In GA4: **Configure** â†’ **Audiences**
2. Click **New audience**
3. Use templates or create custom conditions
4. Enable "Eligible for advertising"
5. Audiences will sync to linked Google Ads account

---

### 7. **Set Up Ecommerce Tracking** (For Purchase Conversion Value)

Currently, you track conversions but not full ecommerce data. This would give Google Ads better optimization data.

**Implementation Needed:**
Update your booking success pages to send ecommerce events:

```typescript
// After successful booking
window.gtag('event', 'purchase', {
  transaction_id: 'BOOKING_ID',
  value: totalPrice,
  currency: 'EUR',
  items: [
    {
      item_id: packageId,
      item_name: packageTitle,
      item_category: 'Tour Package',
      quantity: numberOfPeople,
      price: pricePerPerson
    }
  ]
});
```

**Benefits:**
- Google Ads can optimize for conversion value (not just conversion count)
- Better ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) optimization
- Revenue reporting in GA4

---

### 8. **Enable Google Signals** (Cross-Device Tracking)

Tracks users across devices when signed into Google.

**Enable:**
1. GA4 Admin â†’ **Data Settings** â†’ **Data Collection**
2. Toggle **Google signals data collection** ON
3. Accept terms

**Benefits:**
- Better attribution (users who research on mobile, book on desktop)
- Demographics & interests data
- Remarketing across devices

---

### 9. **Set Up Conversion Import to Google Ads**

Import your GA4 key events as Google Ads conversions.

**Steps:**
1. In Google Ads: **Tools** â†’ **Conversions**
2. Click **+ New conversion action**
3. Select **Import** â†’ **Google Analytics 4**
4. Select your GA4 property
5. Choose key events to import
6. Configure conversion settings:
   - Value: Use values from GA4
   - Count: One (for leads), Every (for purchases)

---

### 10. **Verify Setup with Google Tag Assistant**

Test everything is working properly.

**Steps:**
1. Install [Google Tag Assistant Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tag-assistant-companion/ehsjmnmopngfinljjbmbibgolakknibl)
2. Visit your website: https://funnytourism.com
3. Click Tag Assistant icon
4. Verify you see:
   - âœ… GA4 Configuration tag
   - âœ… Google Ads tag
   - âœ… Conversion events when you complete actions

---

## ðŸ”§ Technical Notes

### Your Current Implementation is Correct âœ…

Your `components/AnalyticsScripts.tsx` uses the right approach:
- Uses `next/script` with `strategy="afterInteractive"` (optimal for performance)
- Loads gtag.js only once for both GA4 and Google Ads
- Proper TypeScript declarations
- Supports optional GTM

### No Code Changes Needed Unless:
1. You want to add GTM (just update .env with real GTM ID)
2. You want to add ecommerce tracking (need to update booking success pages)
3. You want to add custom event tracking (optional)
