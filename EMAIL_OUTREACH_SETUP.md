   Total leads with email: 562
   Contacted: 0
   Remaining: 562

```

### Send Emails (Manual)

```bash
npm run send-outreach
```

```
üìß Starting Agent Outreach Campaign...

‚úÖ Email server connection verified

üìä Daily Email Status:
   Sent today: 0

```

### Export Leads to Excel

```bash
npm run send-outreach export > leads.csv
```

Then open `leads.csv` in Excel or Google Sheets.

## Automated Daily Sending

### Set Up Cron Job (Production Server)

SSH into server and add cron job:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add this line to send emails daily at 10:00 AM:

```
0 10 * * * cd /home/funny/funny_new && npm run send-outreach >> /home/funny/logs/email-outreach.log 2>&1
```

**Alternative schedules:**

```bash
# Every day at 9:00 AM
0 9 * * * cd /home/funny/funny_new && npm run send-outreach

# Monday to Friday at 10:00 AM
0 10 * * 1-5 cd /home/funny/funny_new && npm run send-outreach

# Twice daily (10 AM and 3 PM)
0 10,15 * * * cd /home/funny/funny_new && npm run send-outreach
```

### View Logs

```bash
tail -f ~/logs/email-outreach.log
```

## Daily Limit Logic

The system automatically prevents sending more than 100 emails per day:

1. **Counts emails sent today** - Checks `contacted: true` records updated today
2. **Calculates remaining** - `100 - sent_today`
3. **Fetches only remaining leads** - Gets next batch of uncontacted leads
4. **Stops at limit** - If limit reached, waits until tomorrow

Example:
- Day 1: Sends 100 emails ‚Üí Daily limit reached
- Day 2: Sends next 100 emails ‚Üí Daily limit reached
- Day 3: Sends next 100 emails ‚Üí etc.

With 562 leads, it will take **6 days** to contact everyone (100+100+100+100+100+62).

## Email Content Personalization

Each email is personalized with:

- **Company Name**: "Dear ABC Travel Agency Team,"
- **City**: "Direct Flights from New York to Istanbul"
- **Country**: "I noticed that you offer travel services in New York, USA"

## Tracking & Analytics

### Database Tracking

Each sent email updates the AgentLead record:

```typescript
{
  contacted: true,  // Marks as contacted
  notes: "[Outreach email sent: 2025-01-15T10:30:00Z]"  // Appends timestamp
}
```

### BCC Archive

All emails are BCC'd to `info@funnytourism.com`, creating an automatic archive for:

- **Response tracking** - See who replies
- **Compliance** - Proof of sent emails
- **Quality control** - Review actual sent content
- **Follow-up** - Identify interested agencies

## Email Deliverability Tips

### Improve Delivery Rates

1. **Warm Up Your Domain**
   - Start with 10-20 emails/day for first week
   - Gradually increase to 100/day over 2-3 weeks

2. **SPF, DKIM, DMARC Records**
   - Add proper DNS records for funnytourism.com
   - Verify with mail-tester.com

3. **Clean Email List**
   - Remove invalid emails before sending
   - Use email verification service (e.g., ZeroBounce)

4. **Monitor Bounce Rate**
   - Keep bounce rate below 5%
   - Remove bounced emails from list

5. **Track Opens/Clicks** (Optional)
   - Add tracking pixels
   - Use link shorteners with analytics

### Avoid Spam Filters

‚úÖ **Good Practices:**
- Personalized content (company name, location)
- Professional from address (info@funnytourism.com)
- Clear unsubscribe option
- Legitimate business purpose
- 2-second delay between sends

‚ùå **Avoid:**
- ALL CAPS subject lines
- Too many exclamation marks!!!
- Misleading subject lines
- Purchased email lists
- Sending too fast (rate limiting)

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Email server connection failed"

**Solution**: Check SMTP credentials in `.env`

```bash
# Test SMTP connection
npm run test-email
```

### Error: "Daily limit reached"

**Solution**: Wait until tomorrow, or increase limit in `scripts/send-agent-outreach.ts`:

```typescript
const DAILY_LIMIT = 200; // Increase to 200
```

### Error: "Authentication failed"

**Gmail**: Make sure you're using App Password, not regular password
**SendGrid**: Verify username is exactly `apikey`
**AWS SES**: Check SMTP credentials (different from AWS access keys)

### Emails Going to Spam

1. **Set up SPF record**:
   ```
   v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all
   ```

2. **Set up DKIM** (via Gmail/SendGrid settings)

3. **Test with mail-tester.com**:
   - Send test email to the address they provide
   - Check spam score (aim for 10/10)

### No Emails Being Sent

Check campaign status:

```bash
npm run send-outreach status
```

Verify leads exist:
```bash
npx prisma studio
# Navigate to AgentLead model
# Check: email field is not null, contacted = false
```

## Response Handling

### Monitor Replies

Check `info@funnytourism.com` inbox daily for:

- ‚úÖ **Interested Agencies** - Forward to sales team
- ‚ùå **Unsubscribe Requests** - Mark as contacted, add note
- ‚ùì **Questions** - Respond with package details
- üö´ **Bounce Backs** - Update email or remove lead

### Convert to Agent

When agency wants to partner:

1. Send them partnership agreement
2. Create agent account:
   ```bash
   npm run create-agent
   ```
3. Update AgentLead record:
   ```typescript
   convertedToAgent: true
   ```
